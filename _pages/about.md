I'm a product director at [Decoded](https://decoded.com) in New York. At Decoded
I build and deliver data skills and digital leadership programs, working with
global clients across financial services, retail, manufacturing and government 
to accelerate strategic investment in technology and data capabilities.

Next to my work at Decoded, I'm also part of the advisory board for [Battery 
Associates](https://battery.associates). As an advisor, I support the team at 
BA in creating a platform for talent development and sourcing in the battery 
technology landscape.

I started my career as a data scientist with [Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk)
in London, UK. Since joining in early 2017, I worked on development and 
production deployment of algorithms for personalization and inventory management.
As the third data science hire, I helped grow the team to ten members and led
a squad responsible for the company's warehouse optimization algorithms.

Prior to joining Gousto, I completed a PhD in Management Science at the 
University of Cambridge, [Judge Business School](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/home/),
and spent time as a visiting researcher at the [MIT-SUTD International Design Centre](https://idc.sutd.edu.sg)
in Singapore. I hold a BA in Liberal Arts and Sciences (Maths & Economics) from
[University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht), 
Utrecht University.
