I started my career in data science with [Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk)
in London, UK. Since joining in early 2017, I worked on development and 
production deployment of algorithms for personalization and inventory management.
As the third data science hire, I helped grow the team to ten members and led
a squad responsible for the company's warehouse optimization algorithms.

Prior to joining Gousto, I completed a PhD in Management Science at the 
University of Cambridge, [Judge Business School](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/home/), and spent time as a visiting 
researcher at the [MIT-SUTD International Design Centre](https://idc.sutd.edu.sg)
in Singapore. I hold a BA in Liberal Arts and Sciences (Maths & Economics) from
[University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht), Utrecht
University.
