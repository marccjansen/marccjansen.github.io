I'm a senior data scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science), based in
New York City. At Amazon I'm working on data products and optimization within 
the Seller Fees team. 

Before joining Amazon, I helped build and deliver data skills and digital 
leadership programs as a product director at [Decoded](https://www.decoded.com).
I worked with senior leadership across global clients in financial services, 
retail, and government, helping improve their understanding of the data and
technology landscape.

Next to my work at Decoded, I was also part of the advisory board for [Battery 
Associates](https://battery.associates). As an advisor, I supported the team at 
BA in creating a platform for talent development and sourcing in the battery 
technology landscape.

I started my career as a data scientist with [Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk)
in London, UK. Since joining in early 2017, I worked on development and 
production deployment of algorithms for personalization and inventory management.
As the third data science hire, I helped grow the team to ten members and led
a squad responsible for the company's warehouse optimization algorithms.
