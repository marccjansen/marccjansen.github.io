Gousto is multiple different companies at once. We’re an e-commerce company with 
the expected digital ecosystem allowing users to go through the experience of 
selecting and buying a product, giving feedback, sorting out payments all on

door as a customer involves a lot of ‘real world’ interactions: purchasing the 
required stock, moving this stock from our warehouse to the picking line,
