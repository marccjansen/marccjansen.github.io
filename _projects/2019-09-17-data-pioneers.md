Between November 2018 and March 2019 I had the incredible opportunity to be part
of a documentary on the current state and evolution of the field of data science. 
The documentary was commissioned by [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com) and 
produced by [Luminante](http://www.luminante.com). I was one of 20 interviewees 
representing data-driven companies across London, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris and 
New York. 

The documentary was released publicly on September 17, 2019. Have a 
look at the trailer and a snapshot of my role in the documentary below!
